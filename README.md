datastream.json
===============

Our atom.

This data structure is the eminent ingredient involved in any human-machine machine-machine project, as well as pretty much all of human life as we know it, even if you don't know it.

All applications and services evolves from this one structure which is curated by the users and machines who
push through txts, fill out forms, click buttons, touch on screens, follow others, like things and move amongst beacons
placed around us.

This structure is the Life of all products, services and policies. All decisions and transactions stem from a nested list of human and machine generated data.

Everyone has his or her own datastream.json somewhere, the XNA Team would like you to help shape the one we create for users of our services. Take part in your world now. 

Let's Evolve, let's get Free.
We are Technology.
