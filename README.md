loqootv/datastream.json
===============

Our atom.

This data structure is pretty much the eminent ingredient involved in the project.

All LoQoo's applications evolves based on this one structure which is created by the users who
push through txts, fill out forms, click buttons, touch on screens, move through and amongst beacons
placed amongst us.

This structure is the Life of our Products and Services.

Help us Evolve.

Eventually every user will have his or her own datastream.json, that we would like you to curate and control,
as it streams through our services.
